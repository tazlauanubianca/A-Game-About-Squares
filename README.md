#A Game About Squares

The current project is a haskell game in which a number of squares are placed in a grid and have to be moved to end in a certain position.
The goal is to move each square in a cell in the grade that has the same color ar the square. The difficulty is provided by obstacles placed throughout the grid and different features that can change the direction in which a square can move.

Testing method:
    > stack runhaskell GASTest

Running one individual test:
    > runTestPP <numeTest>
